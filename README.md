  <li>React</li>
  <li>Ruby on Rails as API</li>

# Challenge 

Integrating google maps API to the project was challenging. With google maps documentation and other resources, i managed to integrate google maps API to the project. The other challenge i faced was finding the right layout to mimic AirBnb's web application. After long hours of studying the user interface, i was successful in getting most of the layout.
